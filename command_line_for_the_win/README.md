    I took the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.


    I Opened a terminal on my local machine.


    I used the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. using the hostname, username, and password provided for the sandbox environment.


    Once connected, I navigated to the directory I wanted to upload the screenshots.
	

I used the lls and lpwd to figure where i was in the local directory on my machine


    I used the SFTP 'PUT' command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.


    I confirmed that the screenshots had been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.


    Once the screenshots were transferred, I proceeded to push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.
    

    The screenshoots of completed level are inside the dir /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
